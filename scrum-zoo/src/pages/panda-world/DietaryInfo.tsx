            <p>Pandas primarily eat bamboo, but they also consume other plants and occasionally small animals.</p>
            <p>Here are some key points about their diet:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bamboo makes up about 99% of a panda's diet.</li>
                <li>They can eat up to 40 pounds of bamboo in a single day.</li>
                <li>Pandas have a very low metabolic rate, which is why they need to eat so much bamboo.</li>
                <li>In addition to bamboo, pandas may eat fruits, vegetables, and meat.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
